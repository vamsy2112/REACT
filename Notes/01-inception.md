# The first lesson - inception

- we saw CDNs of React. website is: wwww.legacy.reactjs.org

- In the App.js file, we saw how to create the elements from React using React.createElement

- We also saw how difficult it is to write it.

- React.createElement() at the end of the day is an object

- We separated js into other file, css into other and initialised git in this current folder.
