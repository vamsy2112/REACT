# the fourth lesson

- Lets design a swiggy website as below architecture which is very high level:

- App Layout
  - Header
    - Logo
    - Nav items
  - Body
    - ResContainer
      - ResCard
        - ResLogo
        - Cuisines
        - Price for two
        - Ratings
  - Footer

- saw what are props after restructuring the code into multiple files.
- make sure to pass a unique id to map function.
- props are short of properties which are same as passing argguments into a function. so in js, we pass them as arguments in a function. but in react, js is written in between curly braces so we always write or pass the props between curly braces.
- we have seen what are default imports and named imports.
- always write the component name like the first letter of the comonent in Capital letter.
