# the third lesson

- saw the scripts obj in package.json.
- wrote the scripts for starting the dev and prod builds in package.json
- this way we dont have to start the server/our app by saying **npx parcel index.html**. but simply **npm run start** or **npm start**
- saw what is JSX in react. React and JSX are two different things. If you console the jsx heading (see jsx heading in App.js file)
- **JSX is converted to React.createElement()** behind the scenes, it is nothing but JS object. it is later converted to react element and gets transpiled as HTML element before it reaches to JS engine in browser. This is done by **Parcel and Babel**
- saw what is react element, react component, since react functional component at the end of the day is just a normal js function, tried to write it in between the components within {}.
- we can write any js expression within {} in a react functional component.
